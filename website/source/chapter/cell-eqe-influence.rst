Impact of cell-to-cell EQE variation on power output
====================================================

Introduction
------------
Cells in a PV module are typically connected in series, hence module
performance is limited by the cell generating the lowest current.  Reduced cell
performance can arise from manufacturing inconsistencies between cells, or
in-operando events such as localised temperature hotspots and non-uniform
module degradation.

Previous studies have investigated how external envrionmental factors
such as non-uniform shading can lead to reduced individual cell or module
performance resulting in mismatch losses.  While manufacturing inconsistencies
between cells are often cited as a cause of intramodule mismatch losses, they
are typically overlooked in the existing body of research.

One way to study the inherent differences between cells is through analyzing
their external quantum efficiency (EQE).  A cell's EQE curve represents the
efficiency with which incident photons of different wavelengths generate a
photocurrent.  Although this spectral effect on PV performance has been studied
at the module level, no studies have analysed the spectral effect at the cell
level and its potential role as a driver of mismatch losses at the module
level.  

To investigate the role of cell-to-cell variation on module performance, the
following questions are proposed:

#. Does the EQE vary between cells and if so what is the scale of variation?
#. What is the impact of EQE variation, if present, on module performance?
#. Do the performance variation exhibit vary with geography and/or seasons? 

XXX should these line up exactly with the chapter headings OR could the
phrasing vary? XXX

XXX alternative:XXX

#. How does the EQE vary between cells?
#. What is the impact on PV performance?
#. Does the performance impact vary seasonally or geographically?
